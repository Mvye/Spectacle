## Overview
### Description
Our app is meant to be a place for you to comment on episodes of shows you're watching and chat with other people who are also following a show. 

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Entertainment/Social
- **Mobile:** This app is primarily developed for mobile. A mobile app will allow users more convenience to use it whenever they're watching a show.
- **Story:** This app allows users to chat/discuss ongoing/archived TV shows. Users can post their comments to a live chat or discussion thread.
- **Market:** This market appeals to the same market as Netflix/Reddit. Specifically, people who's favorite pasttime is watching TV shows and then discussing it with other people.
- **Habit:** This app will hopefully compliment the user's TV watching experience enough to piggyback off their already established habit. Additionally, with being able to discuss your favorite TV shows with other fans, this should add another element of attachment.
- **Scope:** We will be developing a proof-of-concept with the app by supporting sign up/log in and 2-3 TV shows with full functionality in terms of chatting, discussing, etc.
